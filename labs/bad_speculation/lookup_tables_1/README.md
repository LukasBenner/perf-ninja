**TODO**: add an introductory and a summary videos.

Welcome to the next lab assignment, where we will fight branch mispredictions by replacing them with lookup tables. The code in this lab assignment maps values from `[0;99]` into buckets, which involves a lot of comparisons, and so, branches. To solve this assignment you need to figure out a way how to replace branches.

Bonus question: how would you solve it if the range of possible values will be bigger, say `[0;10000]`?
